h2. Scala training - code

This github project is the code used for the Scala training course. It is recommended to solve them supervised during a training session.

The slides which go along with the code is kept at "Scala training slides":http://github.com/javaBin/scala-training-slides. You should check out the readme in the slide project to understand a little bit more of the background for the training class and how we performed it.

Adopted for Scala Accenture Riga camp

h3. Topics


The code has been divided into the following topics
* First class functions - various exercises covering use of first class functions
* Pattern matching - various types of pattern matching
* oo-traits - exploring some of the topics around object orientation and trait support. Also a few exercises exploring syntax.

We believe these tasks are enough for day one of the course. Second day would typically be only the quiz project, which is a larger task. To solve it you must parse some XML, write a console app and a Scala Swing app.
